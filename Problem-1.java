 * Uses an array of lists (buckets) to store keys with chaining for collision handling.
 * 1. buckets: an array of ArrayLists, each holding integers that hash to the same index.
 * 2. PRIME: a prime number used for modulo to distribute keys evenly.

 * - hash(key): computes index using a simple hash function.
 * - add: places key in its bucket if not already present.
 * - remove: deletes key from its bucket if it exists.
 * - contains: checks if key exists in its computed bucket.

/*
* Another approach I thought was to take an boolean array[1001][1001] that can easily accomodate the input range till 10^6
* and mark true for the [key/1001][key%1001] which will eventually be unique for every unique key
But this approach is not properly hashing but it is open addressing
